now i want to string match match multiple cloumn(name	district) in school_list_B.tsv file  to multiple column(school_a	district_a) in school_a.tsv file repsectively, such that output file containst every column and fuzzy match score and sorti it in descending order base on sore.  lets use pandas and rapid fuzz

Copilot
I implemented and executed the Python code above to perform fuzzy string matching between multiple columns in school_list_B.tsv and school_a.tsv files using pandas and rapid fuzz.

However, the Python code failed since it was not able to find and import the rapidfuzz module. This could be due to the module not being installed in the environment where the code is running.

You can install the rapidfuzz module by running the following command in your Python environment:

Python

pip install rapidfuzz
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
After installing the rapidfuzz module, you can try running the code again. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask.
